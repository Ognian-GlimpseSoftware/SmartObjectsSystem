# SmartObjectsSystem
Unity game object that can morph into any type of custom game object or prefab

 The 'Smart Game Objects System' is a Unity editor 
 extension, designed to create instances from a 
 collection of prefabs inside the Unity editor. You 
 can create and configure a library of custom game
 objects and then use a single smart game object 
 that can morph into any other from that library.
